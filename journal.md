So far, the most challenging thing about learning Python for me (although I haven't gotten far), is distinguishing how different code works with input and output. This includes typecasting, the int() and str() command. The thing I find most interesting is the language in general because I have always had an interest in coding, I just find medicine more interesting.

Following instructions exactly as they are written is important when learning how to code because one simple mistake can cause the code to either not perform correctly, or not perform at all. For example, when using int() and str() to do math calulations such as addition, you always have to make sure to convert all numbers back to string, or else the code won't work to add the given numbers. For this reason, it is important to develop the habit of paying attention to detail early while learning coding so that these mistakes won't be made as often.

One thing that requires the use of computer science that I use in my everydya life is websites I do schoolwork on, such as Canvas, Khan Academy, and Google Docs. WIthout these websites, school work would all have to be handwritten and it would slow learning down. In short, I would not be where I am now without websites like Khan Academy or Canvas, education would not be as easy to get as it is now.

I decided to research about bioinformatics in the computer science field. Bioinformatics is described as having a focus on dissecting enormous datasets related to things like genetic sequencing, proteomics, and other biological data. ALso comes up with new innovations such as fingerprint scanners, ways to treat diseases, and more.  It requires skills such as statistical and mathematical skills, computer programming skills, general biology knowledge, machine learning skills, problem solving skills, and communication skills. There is a significant amount of education required, including: a Bachelor's degree, Post-grad programs, University level teaching & research, and administrative positions require a graduate's degree. Bioinformatics is projected to grow 22% by 2030, and opprotunities for growth and advancemeng include: specializing in specific areas like genomics, drug discovery, data integration, computational biology, developing new algorithms, moving into leadership roles within research teams, transitioning to industry positions in pharmaceutical companies, or pursuing further education to become a bioinformatics scientist or biostatistician. Although I don't generally have goals to pursue computer science, bioinformatics is important in medcine. It has shown to have a large impact on health science now, and most likely will continue to in the future, which is why it's important to know about.

Coding can improve problem solving skills because mistakes are made a lot in coding programs, like Python, and those mistakes require you to figure out the problem in your coding before you can solve the problen, hence requiring you to develop problem solving skills. Understanding code helps in industries that aren't directly related to technology because coding is what makes up the stuff we use in everyday life. For example in healthcare, coding is used to translate patient information into universal medical codes to help with billing, record keeping, research, tracking patient outcomes, and more. Coding enchances creativity and collaboration because it encourages problem-solving(as mentioned above), supports personal and collaborative projects, enables experimentation, and and provides practical applications.

AI improves efficiency in healthcare by reducing the workload of people to collect data from patients, appointment scheduling, analyzing patterns in patient data. AI can also improve diagnostics, including X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to double check abnormalities in a patient, leading to an accurate diagnosis. In education, AI can also reduce the workload of teachers by automatically grading assignments, tracking attendance, and virtual tutoring with AI explanations of a topic. AI improves efficiency and innovation in transportation by automating fast routes in GPS, predicting traffic patterns in GPS, and there are certain innovations in transportation such as drone delivery and auto-pilot vehicles. 
AI can be harmful to all fields, because it can decrease the number of jobs available overall. In healthcare, AI can be unreliable in terms of patient data, because sensitive patient data can easily be leaked. AI is only as knowledgeable as the information it is trained on, so in education it may be unreliable or have biased information.
