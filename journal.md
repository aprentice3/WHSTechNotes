So far, the most challenging thing about learning Python for me (although I haven't gotten far), is distinguishing how different code works with input and output. This includes typecasting, the int() and str() command. The thing I find most interesting is the language in general because I have always had an interest in coding, I just find medicine more interesting.

Following instructions exactly as they are written is important when learning how to code because one simple mistake can cause the code to either not perform correctly, or not perform at all. For example, when using int() and str() to do math calulations such as addition, you always have to make sure to convert all numbers back to string, or else the code won't work to add the given numbers. For this reason, it is important to develop the habit of paying attention to detail early while learning coding so that these mistakes won't be made as often.
