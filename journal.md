So far, the most challenging thing about learning Python for me (although I haven't gotten far), is distinguishing how different code works with input and output. This includes typecasting, the int() and str() command. The thing I find most interesting is the language in general because I have always had an interest in coding, I just find medicine more interesting.

Following instructions exactly as they are written is important when learning how to code because one simple mistake can cause the code to either not perform correctly, or not perform at all. For example, when using int() and str() to do math calulations such as addition, you always have to make sure to convert all numbers back to string, or else the code won't work to add the given numbers. For this reason, it is important to develop the habit of paying attention to detail early while learning coding so that these mistakes won't be made as often.

One thing that requires the use of computer science that I use in my everydya life is websites I do schoolwork on, such as Canvas, Khan Academy, and Google Docs. WIthout these websites, school work would all have to be handwritten and it would slow learning down. In short, I would not be where I am now without websites like Khan Academy or Canvas, education would not be as easy to get as it is now.

I decided to research about bioinformatics in the computer science field. Bioinformatics is described as having a focus on dissecting enormous datasets related to things like genetic sequencing, proteomics, and other biological data. ALso comes up with new innovations such as fingerprint scanners, ways to treat diseases, and more.  It requires skills such as statistical and mathematical skills, computer programming skills, general biology knowledge, machine learning skills, problem solving skills, and communication skills. There is a significant amount of education required, including: a Bachelor's degree, Post-grad programs, University level teaching & research, and administrative positions require a graduate's degree. Bioinformatics is projected to grow 22% by 2030, and opprotunities for growth and advancemeng include: specializing in specific areas like genomics, drug discovery, data integration, computational biology, developing new algorithms, moving into leadership roles within research teams, transitioning to industry positions in pharmaceutical companies, or pursuing further education to become a bioinformatics scientist or biostatistician. Although I don't generally have goals to pursue computer science, bioinformatics is important in medcine. It has shown to have a large impact on health science now, and most likely will continue to in the future, which is why it's important to know about.

Coding can improve problem solving skills because mistakes are made a lot in coding programs, like Python, and those mistakes require you to figure out the problem in your coding before you can solve the problen, hence requiring you to develop problem solving skills. Understanding code helps in industries that aren't directly related to technology because coding is what makes up the stuff we use in everyday life. For example in healthcare, coding is used to translate patient information into universal medical codes to help with billing, record keeping, research, tracking patient outcomes, and more. Coding enchances creativity and collaboration because it encourages problem-solving(as mentioned above), supports personal and collaborative projects, enables experimentation, and and provides practical applications.

AI improves efficiency in healthcare by reducing the workload of people to collect data from patients, appointment scheduling, analyzing patterns in patient data. AI can also improve diagnostics, including X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to double check abnormalities in a patient, leading to an accurate diagnosis. In education, AI can also reduce the workload of teachers by automatically grading assignments, tracking attendance, and virtual tutoring with AI explanations of a topic. AI improves efficiency and innovation in transportation by automating fast routes in GPS, predicting traffic patterns in GPS, and there are certain innovations in transportation such as drone delivery and auto-pilot vehicles. 
AI can be harmful to all fields, because it can decrease the number of jobs available overall. In healthcare, AI can be unreliable in terms of patient data, because sensitive patient data can easily be leaked. AI is only as knowledgeable as the information it is trained on, so in education it may be unreliable or have biased information.

One positive impact about technology in the election is that it gives people running for office an extra way to convince the population to vote for them. Social media is one technological way to do this. Personally, I've seen various posts informing or debating about Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, good and bad. A challenge for people running for office is that misinformation is constantly spread online, and with multiple people possibly spreading misinformation online it is hard for them to address the misinformation directly.

It is important to protect your personal and private information online mostly because it can be used against you, or percieved in a way you didn't intend for it to be perceived in. For example, if you post about your dog dying, then people who don't like you could make fun of you for it, or anonymously bully you for it. We can ensure that the information we share on social media platforms remain secure by having a private account, and furthermore securing it by having a strong password. Personally, I haven't shared something online that I later realized was too personal, but if I were to today I would delete the information (even though it stays on the internet forever) and reflect on my actions. We can balance being both open and collaborative in online spaces while still protecting your privacy by sharing your experiences but not too many details.

The recent Trump-Harris election is an event that is impacting the community. Data analysis plays a crucial role in understanding voter behavior, predicting outcomes, and ensuring fair processes, while problem-solving is essential for addressing challenges like misinformation and voter accessibility. Insights from this data help campaigns optimize strategies and governments ensure efficient and secure elections.
Advancements in computer science, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, could enhance election security, streamline voter registration, and detect misinformation more effectively. AI-powered tools can analyze vast amounts of data to identify trends or threats, while blockchain could offer secure and transparent voting methods. These innovations have the potential to bolster trust in democratic systems and improve accessibility for future elections.

Technology has significantly transformed the way we grow, distribute, and purchase food, enhancing convenience and efficiency. Advanced agricultural technologies, such as precision farming and automated irrigation systems, have boosted crop yields and reduced waste, making food more affordable. During the holiday season, online grocery platforms and delivery services make it easier for consumers to access festive foods without leaving their homes. Additionally, technologies like refrigeration and improved logistics ensure perishable items can travel long distances, expanding access to a wider variety of foods. However, heavy reliance on technology has drawbacks, including vulnerabilities in the supply chain, such as cyberattacks or technical failures, which could disrupt food availability. Moreover, the environmental impact of energy-intensive farming practices and excessive packaging associated with online shopping raises concerns about sustainability.

AI is now starting to impact healthcare, with tools such as an AI that detects heart disease in CT scans. This recent development can imoact society in both bad and good ways, such as it's ability to give a "second opinion" to diagnosticians. If improved enough, this could replace doctors entirely, which is unlikely however it does put jobs at risk. I personally am going into healthcare, and the introduction of AI into my career is worrysome for thus reason. Additionally, my daily life may be affected because with all of this new technology being developed, I have to keep up so I am aware of every tool in healthcare, and porblems they may cause. This is a lot for one person, which is why AI may generally be harmful in healthcare.

To me, the term "brain rot" is something that doesn't seem humourous, however somehow is funny in a weird way. In my opinion, digital media has had a positive impact on my mental well-being, because I get to keep up with the latest news and also be entertained. In regards to technology, I have never heard of the word "slop" before, but "lore" is a word I use commonly when I try to find out some backround information. It is possible to balance meaningful engagement with technology while avoiding brain rot, because algorthims on social media are made to be tweaked to your interests, so if you are not interested in brain rot, you will not see it anywhere.

I enjoy the flexibility of this class because I am able to work on other classwork and study if necessary. I do not think anything can be improved, except the loudness of the class (which i know is not under your control), and I have no feedback as of now. Looking ahead I'd like to spend more time on learning Python than I did last semester because I did very little, given that I had a lot of work from other classes.

The shift in the tech industry towards prioritizing artificial intelligence (AI) skills over traditional tech roles signifies a significant evolution driven by the increasing integration of AI into various sectors. This transition suggests a growing demand for professionals who can develop, implement, and manage AI technologies effectively. While it opens up new avenues for innovation and efficiency across industries, there are concerns about potential job displacement and skill gaps for those in more traditional roles. However, I believe that AI tools ultimately enhance opportunities for workers by creating new job roles and fostering demand for specialized skills in AI development, data science, and machine learning. To prepare for a career in this rapidly changing job market, it's crucial to focus on acquiring a solid foundation in AI concepts, programming languages relevant to AI (such as Python and R), and gaining practical experience through projects or internships. Additionally, developing a strong understanding of ethical considerations in AI and continuous learning will be essential to staying competitive and adaptable in this dynamic field.

I think government intervention impacts technology companies and its users in negative ways. For example, with the recent Tiktok ban, there was a lot of backlash because people said the government was taking away their right to free speech, causing stress within the younger generation who is most likely to use the app. As for companies, it may cause them to want to increase user privacy features in fear of getting banned aswell. Addressing security concerns in order to operate globally is something Tiktok has already attempted, however the U.S. Senate would not budge with the ban, so I fear companies like Tiktok may not stand a chance soon when it comes to operating globally. 
If I were a developer at Tiktok working on a new feauture to increase user privacy, I would suggest having a feature in settings, seperate from Tiktok guidelines, specifically outlining the amount of privancy/security an average American has while using the app, in simple terms that an average 13 year old could understand. This would ensure that no matter the person, those who can use the app have an idea about their privacy and why it is important, as well as providing reassurance to everyone involved. I have learned that this may be a useful feauture in my own projects, as it's similar to an abstract in a scientific paper.

Computer science plays a critical role in aviation safety with things such as location tracking and alert systems. With the recent mid-air collision over Washington D.C., these factors could have played a critical role. To make sure something like this does not happen again, we could make location of air stuffs more accurance and/or precise, and alert systems more detailed and clear.
