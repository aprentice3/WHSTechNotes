1. Three sensors found on the Sphero BOLT are the compass sensor, ambient light sensor, and infrared sensor.
2. The compass sensor, which is a built in magnetometer, measures magnestism. The magnetometer's design allows it to measure Earth's magnetic field and guide you to magnetic north, making it useful as a compass. In order to make it function, we have to program it. The program works as the following: First, 'on start porgram', connect 'calibrate compass', then 'compass direction (0 degrees)', and finally 'matrix animation', with an arrow pointing north.
